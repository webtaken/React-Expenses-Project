# Expenses Project

On this miniproject I learned the basic concepts of [React JS](https://es.reactjs.org/):

- JSX.
- Components.
- `props`
- `useState`.
- Conditional display.
- List Rendering.
- CSS modules.
- etc...

# Closer Look

On image bellow you can see the frontend of the project, very simple responsive design.

Just download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/download/), then run on the root folder's terminal of this project:

```
$ npm install && npm start
```
